:exclamation: Setting up a project with this stack has become so much easier and better now using the Vue CLI. However, back then no ready-made template for this stack existed and custom boilerplates were still a thing.

Please, don't even think about using this today. The dependencies are outdated anyway. 


# vue-typescript-tailwind

> VueJS + TypeScript + Sass + PostCSS + Tailwind boilerplate based on Vue PWA template.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```
